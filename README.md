**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation**
> The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method estimates the present value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. By applying a discount rate, DCF accounts for the time value of money, helping investors determine whether the investment will generate enough cash to make it worthwhile. A DCF calculation considers all projected cash flows and brings them to today's value, providing a more accurate evaluation of the potential returns over time.

**Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)**
> A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) allows investors to withdraw a fixed or variable amount from their investments at regular intervals. Unlike a lump-sum withdrawal, SWP provides a steady income while keeping the remaining investments in place. Itâ€™s particularly useful for retirees or those seeking to fund recurring expenses without fully depleting their investment capital. SWP is customizable to fit individual needs, offering flexibility in withdrawal frequency and amount to ensure a sustained income stream.



**Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)**
> A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a disciplined way of investing a fixed amount in mutual funds at regular intervals, typically monthly. SIP helps in averaging the cost of investment and harnesses the power of compounding. Ideal for long-term financial goals, SIPs allow investors to enter the market gradually, making it easier to handle market volatility. Over time, SIPs can help build substantial wealth, even with modest contributions, making it a popular choice for investors of all backgrounds.
